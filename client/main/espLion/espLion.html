				<h4>Vision</h4><hr>
					<p>The ESP Lions was officially launched on 28th January 2015 with blessings from Professor Wang Chien Ming, Director of Engineering Science Programme (ESP) and Global Engineering Programme (GEP). 

		Founded by a group of ESP seniors - Thor Jia Wei, Chen Lishi, Eugene Phang, Gwee Chia Hong, the initiative aims to create a platform for aspiring ESPians with a desire to join competitions. It allows ESPians of all levels to meet like-minded peers and form teams. Alumni members can also utilise this platform to provide support for participating teams. 

		By doing so, the initiative strives to create a close-knitted ESP community smile emoticon</p>
